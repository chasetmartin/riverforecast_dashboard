# River Flood Forecasting Dashboard

https://flooddashboard.netlify.app/

### This application is a flood level dashboard designed to provide users with real-time river flood statuses and forecasts, based on the new Preview API from the National Water Prediction Service (NOAA).

**_ This is a test project and should not be used for decision making _**

#### It will eventually allow users to create their own personalized dashboards to monitor the flood levels of specific rivers.

## Features

- Real-time Data: The application fetches real-time data from the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) API, ensuring that users always have the most up-to-date information.

- Flood Statuses and Forecasts: Users can view the current flood status of various rivers, as well as forecasts for future flood levels. The flood statuses are categorized into 'major', 'moderate', 'minor', and 'action' levels.

- Personalized Dashboard: Users will be able to create their own dashboard to monitor specific rivers. This allows users to focus on the rivers that are most relevant to them.
